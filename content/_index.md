![Snyk](/images/snyk-card.png)

### Welcome!

In this workshop you will learn how to scan containerized applications on Google GKE using the Snyk Container CLI tool. We will learn about Open Source vulnerabilities introduced by your Container Base Image and your application dependencies. 

Containers enable you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With containers, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of standardized methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Snyk is a Cloud Native Application Security solution that enables developers and security teams to find and automatically fix vulnerabilities in your source code, Infrastructure as code templates, container images, kubernetes applications, and open source artifacts.

### Learning Objectives
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities using the Snyk CLI
- Integrating Snyk into your SCM system to find and fix Open Source vulnerabilities

## Who should take this workshop?
- Developers 
- DevOps Engineers
- Solutions Architects
- Site Reliability Engineers (SRE's)
- Anyone that loves containers and wants to learn more!
